# I am going to tackle this project with React. 

I am not planning to use any external libriries, i am going to use UNICODE for incons.

General logic will alow for only one API call. All countries wil be stored in a state ad from there
I will design needed manipulation. This approach will be benefificial in speeding up the app and
restricting api calls.

# There will be  seven components

1.MyToggle  - component changing mode dark/Light, also I will plce 


2.MySearch - input filed + search button


3.MyDropdown - custom dropdown as I dont want to use <select> as there are problems with controlling hoe 

it renders

4.BascicCountryView - I'll use this component to render list of countries

5.DetailCountryView
